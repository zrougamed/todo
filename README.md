## Quick Start

### Download Pre-built Binary (Recommended)

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/nirabyte/todo/releases)
2. Download the binary for your system.
3. Extract the folder and run:
   - **Windows**: Double-click `todo.exe` or run `.\todo.exe` in terminal
   - **macOS/Linux**: Run `./todo-app-name` in terminal (you may need to `chmod +x todo-app-name` first)

### Install with Go

If you have Go installed:

```bash
go install github.com/nirabyte/todo@latest
```

Then run:

```bash
todo
```

If Go’s bin directory isn’t in your PATH, add it by running:

```
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
```

Then reload your shell:

```
source ~/.bashrc   # or ~/.zshrc if you use Zsh
```

### Build from Source

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nirabyte/todo.git
   cd todo
   ```

2. Build for your platform:

   ```bash
   # Using Make (if available)
   make build

   # Or manually
   go build -o build/todo ./cmd/todo
   ```

3. Run it:

   ```bash
   # Windows
   .\build\todo.exe

   # macOS/Linux
   ./build/todo
   ```
